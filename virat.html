He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional right arm medium pace bowler. He is called the king, the chase master and the run machine for his playing style, records and ability to lead the team to victory. Kohli is the highest run-scorer in the Indian Premier League, third in T20I, third in ODI, and third in international cricket. Regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time, he holds the record for the most ODI centuries and has the second most centuries in international cricket.
